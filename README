This software provides a modernized interface for PSOPT.



Installation:

Currently the installation works out of the box for Windows with
MinGW.

On Windows follow the instructions of
https://github.com/Sauermann/psopt-installer

Using a MSYS shell for installation do:

make PSOPT=$DIRECTORY_OF_PSOPT_INSTALLATION
make install PREFIX=$DIRECTORY_OF_PSOPT_INSTALLATION/.target

where you replace $DIRECTORY_OF_PSOPT_INSTALLATION by the installation
directory of PSOPT.



If you are not using the installer, be aware that the following
patches to PSOPT are mandatory:

https://github.com/Sauermann/psopt-installer/blob/master/patches/psopt-c%2B%2B0x-windows.patch
https://github.com/Sauermann/psopt-installer/blob/master/patches/psopt-lambdafunction-windows.patch
https://github.com/Sauermann/psopt-installer/blob/master/patches/psopt-bugfix-static-variable.patch

and you will have to adjust the makefile accordingly.
